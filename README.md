# react-ducks-boilerplate
This is my boilerplate in figuring out how Redux and Ducks play in the world of React. At the moment it looks like Ducks doesn't replace Redux, it's simply a more organized way of using the library.

Looking at it some more it seems that this is still very new and I'm wasting my time trying to implement it. I should get back to learning Redux.

## Installation
```
npm install --save react react-dom
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server
```
## Usage
