# react-ducks-boilerplate
This is my boilerplate in figuring out how Redux and Ducks play in the world of React. At the moment it looks like Ducks doesn't replace Redux, it's simply a more organized way of using the library.

## Installation
```
npm install --save react react-dom redux
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server
```
